Student Registration System
Overview -
The Student Registration System is a web-based application that allows users to manage student records. It provides functionality to add, edit, and delete student details, including name, class, address, email, and contact number. The data is stored persistently in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that records are retained across page reloads.
Features

Add Students: Register new students with their details.
Edit Students: Update existing student records.
Delete Students: Remove student records with a confirmation prompt.
Data Persistence: Student data is saved in localStorage for persistence.
Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly UI.
Scrollable Table: Displays registered students in a table with a vertical scrollbar for large datasets.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the web application.
CSS (Tailwind CSS): Styling for a modern and responsive UI.
JavaScript: Handles form submission, table rendering, and local storage operations.
LocalStorage: Browser-based storage for persistent data.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
